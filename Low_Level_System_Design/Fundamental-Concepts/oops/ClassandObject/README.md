## Class

A class is a blueprint or template. It defines the attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods) of an object.

## Object

An object is an instance of a class. When you create an object, you are bringing the blueprint of the class into reality. It consists of state and behavior defined by the class, with each object holding its own copy of the data.
